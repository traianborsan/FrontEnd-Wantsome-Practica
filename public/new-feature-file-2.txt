A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.

git commit. The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. ... Exchanging commits has to be performed manually and explicitly (with the "git fetch", "git pull", and "git push" commands).
